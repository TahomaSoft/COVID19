<font color="red">Updated: 11th April 2020, 04:10 BST <B>All graphs
have been updated, and I've added new graphs showing daily increase
rates for Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine, Russia, English
Regions, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  I've added
Pennsylvania and Georgia to the US graphs.  I've updated curve
alignments on many graphs, and updated commentary for many of them,
time permitting.  

<P>In general, quite a few countries are showing signs have having
peaked (number of new confirmed cases per day is now decreasing), and
a few are showing signs that the death rate has also
peaked. MJH</B></font>
