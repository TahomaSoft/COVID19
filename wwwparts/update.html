    <font color="red">Updated: 7th April 2020, 03:35 BST <B>All graphs
    have been updated, but not much of the commentary.  You can now
    click on the graphs to get a large version, which is useful when
    curves overlap.  The dataset for Finland had some issues, so I've
    removed those curves for now.  I'll add them back when I
	understand what is going on.
	<P>In general, quite a few countries are showing signs have having peaked (number of new confirmed cases per day is now decreasing), and a few are showing signs that the death rate has also peaked. MJH</B></font>
