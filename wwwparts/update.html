    <font color="red">Updated: 9th April 2020, 03:35 BST <B>All graphs
    have been updated, and I've added new graphs looking at the shape
    of the peak and looking at US states that may be peaking now.
    I've updated the commentary for all 19 European graphs, but not many
    of the others.  

<P>In general, quite a few countries are showing signs have having peaked (number of new confirmed cases per day is now decreasing), and a few are showing signs that the death rate has also peaked. MJH</B></font>
