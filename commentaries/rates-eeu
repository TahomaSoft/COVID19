<LI>Generally, trends are easier to see on a cumulative plot, as
    changes are inherently more noisy.  However, this view is better
    to see whether a country has peaked or not.

<LI>Increase were somewhat level in Bulgaria, which had appeared to
have peaked on March 31st and then declined slowly since.  However the
last three days saw a new surge, and it no longer looks like Bulgaria
has peaked.

<LI>Greece peaked on April 2nd - the daily increase
  was nearly constant for two weeks, and has seen a substantial decline the last two weeks.

<LI> Slovenia and the Czech Republic both appear to have peaked on
March 27th, but the decrease since then has been rather slow, with
both showing a smaller secondary peak.

<LI>Romania and Poland may be peaking now, but the curve is relatively
level, so more data will be required to say whether this is a peak.

<LI>Serbia has seen another surge the last week, and no longer looks like it has peaked.

<LI>Twice before, I had though Slovakia had peaked, and was wrong.
The peak around April 8th is so sharp (cases doubled from 47 to 101, then
dropped back to 19) that the smoothing function I usually apply
misrepresents this peak.  I am showing the rate unsmoothed data for
Slovakia instead.  It seems likely that the high noise on this curve
is due to an artifact in now test results are released.
