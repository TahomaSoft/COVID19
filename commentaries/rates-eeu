<LI>Generally, trends are easier to see on a cumulative plot, as
    changes are inherently more noisy.  However, this view is better
    to see whether a country has peaked or not.

<LI>I thought Slovakia had peaked 16 days ago, then again 7 days ago,
but it appears I was wrong in both cases.  The increase in new cases
the last three days after such a long period of constant growth is
unusual, but I do not know if this is causes by better testing or an
increase in the underlying epidemic.

<LI>Increase are roughly level in Bulgaria, which appears to have
peaked on March 31st, and been declining slowly since.

<LI>Greece appears to have peaked on April 2nd - the daily increase
  had been nearly constant for two weeks, and has turned down more
  significantly the last few days.

<LI> Slovenia and the Czech Republic both appear to have peaked on
March 27th, but the decrease since then has been rather slow, with
both showing a smaller secondary peak.

<LI>Hungary, Romania and Poland may be peaking now, but more data will
be required to say this with confidence.

<LI>Serbia dipped the last two days after a steady exponential
increases the last three weeks.  It is too early to know if this is a
peak.
