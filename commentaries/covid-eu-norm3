<LI>Ireland, Portugal and Belgium all appear to be roughly following
the curve that Italy followed.  In the last week it appears that
Portugal and Ireland are tracking slightly below the Italy curve and
Belgium is tracking slightly above the Italy curve.

<LI>Luxembourg has a very small population, so the curve is noisy.
      However, the last three weeks have taken Luxembourg well above
      the point even Lombardy reached at this stage of the infection.
      As a result I am not showing any time offset between the
      Luxembourg and Italy curves.  However, see the next graph for
      why I am not confident Luxembourg really is quite so close
      behind Italy as this graph would suggest.  Likely the large
      number of cases reported is due to better testing in Luxembourg.
