  <LI>I have aligned the 35% daily increase rate parts of the four
    graphs, so the points at which they diverge can be seen.  As a
    result the graph shows Lombardy as being 5.5 days ahead of Italy,
    but a more realistic value based on today's data points is seven
    days ahead.

  <LI>Lombardy and Italy now appear to have peaked, see Graph 3,
  though the daily increase in cases is not declining rapidly.

  <LI>Switzerland tracked along the 35% curve about six days further
    than Italy did, so comparing with Italy as a whole did not seem to
    be the right baseline.  During this time Lombardy results provided
    a better reference curve.  However in the last week Switzerland
    has dropped off of the Lombardy curve and no longer is seeing
    exponential growth.
    
  <LI>Austria also followed the Lombardy curve pretty faithfully about
  ten days behind.  It now looks like Austria peaked eight days ago,
  and, unlike Lombardy, Austria has seen a pronounced decrease in new
  cases each day since.
