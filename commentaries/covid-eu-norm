<LI> In contrast to graph 1, which highlights any divergence, <B>on this
graph I'm showing these countries aligned with the 8% curve</B> as that is the last common exponential rate that these countries all seem to have followed.  I'm also showing a shorter time interval.

<LI>Italy followed the 8% curve for about five days before
peaking. Italy has now dropped off of exponential increases and the
daily increase count appears to have peaked, though it has not declined greatly..

<LI> France peaked on March 31st with 7578 new cases that day.  Since
then new cases have declined to around 2000 cases per day, though
individual days have been significantly lower or higher.

<LI>Germany peaked twice with the second peak on April 3rd.  New cases
are now lower than 30% of the peak and declining.

<LI>For a long time the UK followed the French curve about one week
behind.  For the last ten days the UK has tracked higher than France,
Cases peaked on April 11th, but have not declined as fast as France
did.  In part this may be due to a change in testing strategy.  Prior
to April 10th, only hospitalized patients ended up in the confirmed
test results.  As of April 21st, 35% of new cases were not
hospitalized patients.  This change accounts for almost all of the
difference between the current UK track and the French track.

<LI> The Netherlands appears to have been holding a roughly constant
daily increase rate for three weeks, with multiple similar peaks of
1172 cases on March 27th, 1083 cases on April 2nd, 1335 cases on April
10th and 1235 cases on April 17th.  This very broad peak may be due to
the Netherlands adopting relatively mild containment measures compared
to neighbouring countries.

<LI>Switzerland has a relatively small population, and so the number
    of cases per million inhabitants is much higher.  Switzerland is
    shown with no time offset to Italy.  
    
<LI> See the <a href="#deaths-eu-norm">this death rates graph</a> for
  why I am not confident in this placement for Switzerland. From that
  graph Switzerland looks to be as much as 10 days behind Italy.

<LI> Switzerland also saw multiple peaks, with 1481 cases on March
  20th, 1447 cases on March 27th, and 1128 cases on April 2nd.  Since
  then cases have declined to around 30% of the peak.
    
<LI>Spain stayed at 35% daily increases for much longer than any other
  large European country, which caused it to close on Italy, then
  followed the 22% curve for a week. Spain only roughly aligned with
  the 13.5% curve, although it joined this curve at roughly the point
  where Italy departed it.  Spain saw peaks of 9372 cases on March
  27th, 10724 cases on March 31st, with smaller peaks of 6278 cases on
  April 8th and 6599 cases on April 15th.  New cases are currently at
  about 40% of the peak.

<LI>Austria followed the Lombardy curve pretty faithfully about ten
  days behind, staying at a higher increase rate for longer than
  Italy.  Austria peaked at 992 cases per day on March 27th and,
  unlike Italy, Austria has seen a fast decrease in new cases since,
  to around 60 cases per day now..
