<LI> In contrast to graph 1, which highlights any divergence, <B>on this
graph I'm showing these countries aligned with the 8% curve</B> as all
of them now appear to have left both the 22% and 13.5% curves.  I'm also showing a shorter time interval.

<LI>Italy followed the 8% curve for about five days before
peaking. Italy has now dropped off of exponential increases and the
daily increase count appears to have peaked, though it has not declined greatly..

<LI> For the last week France and Germany both appear to have been
tracking close to the 8% daily increase curve that Italy followed.
Once increases get this small, it is hard to distinguish constant
increases from exponential increases on this graph.  France appears now to have peaked about 8 days ago.
In the case of Germany, the daily increase in cases has been
relatively constant, though it is not yet clear whether this represents
a peak.

<LI>The UK continues to follow most closely behind France, about 6
days behind.  In general the UK curves have most closely resembled
France for several weeks, so if the UK continues to do so, it should
now be peaking.

<LI> The Netherlands roughly followed the 8% curve for five days, but
the last two days show lower increases. It is starting to look like
cases in the Netherlands may have peaked 10 days ago, but the decrease rate since has been relatively show.

<LI>Switzerland has a relatively small population, and so the number
    of cases per million inhabitants is much higher.  Switzerland is
    shown with no time offset to Italy.  
    
  <LI> See the <a href="#deaths-eu-norm">this death rates graph</a>
    for why I am not confident in this placement for Switzerland. From
    that graph Switzerland looks to be as much as 10 days behind
    Italy.

  <LI> For more than two weeks now, Switzerland has seen roughly constant daily
  increases, which suggests Switzerland may have peaked, but is declining slowly since. 
    
  <LI>Spain stayed at 35% daily increases for much longer than any
    other large European country, which caused it to close on Italy,
    then followed the 22% curve for a week. Spain only roughly aligned
    with the 13.5% curve, although it joined this curve at roughly the
    point where Italy departed it.  For the last two weeks the number
    of new cases in Spain was roughly constant, with the last four 
    days showing a marked decrease.  Spain how appears to have peaked about a week ago.

  <LI>Austria followed the Lombardy curve pretty faithfully about ten
  days behind, staying at a higher increase rate for longer than
  Italy.  Austria peaked ten days ago, and, unlike Italy, Austria has
  seen a pronounced decrease in new cases since.
