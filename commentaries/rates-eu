<LI>Generally, trends are easier to see on a cumulative plot, as
changes are inherently more noisy.  However, this view is better to
see whether a country has peaked or not.

<LI>Spain, Germany and the Netherlands all hint at peaking the
last few days, but it's too early to say so with confidence.  

<LI>France has been following Italy pretty closely, and on that basis should peak within the next week.

<LI>I would expect the UK to not peak for another one to two weeks.
Generally the UK has been following France around a week behind.

<LI>The US and New Zealand are not technically in Western Europe, but I've added them here to aid comparision. 

<LI>The very rapid increase rate in the US appears to have tailed off,
but I suspect it has some way to go before peaking.  As the epidemic
is at different stages in different states, the US curve is less
likely to show a sharp peak when it does occur.  The last two weeks of
the US curve show strong similarities to the equivalent phase of the
Italian curve.

<LI>New Zealand appears to be exhibiting a broad peak, similar to a
number of European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands.
