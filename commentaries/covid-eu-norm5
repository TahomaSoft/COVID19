  <LI>Estonia's small population and recent fast ramp up of cases
  means it now has a high number of cases per million inhabitants. The
  current curve is similar to the Danish data, where most of a wave of
  imported cases was tracked down and exponential growth resumed from
  a lower base.  Estonia now looks to be peaking, but this is not
  certain, and can be seen better on <a href="#rates-nordic">this
  graph.</a>

<LI>Russia is experiencing a lower daily increase rate than most
  northern countries at the equivalent stage of the infection.  I've
  aligned it with the 22% daily increase curve that many countries
  followed.  Recently Russian looks to starting to drop below the 22% curve.

<LI>Latvia and Lithuania are on very similar curves; both look like
they peaked recently, Lithuania on April 4th and Latvia on April 1st,
though it will take a few more days to be confident about this.

<LI>Ukraine was growing at around the 35% rate that is typical of
countries early in the epidemic, then switched to a lower growth rate
the last week.  If the last two data points are continued, Ukraine may
be peaking, but it is too early to be sure.

<LI>I don't understand why the Belarus curve levelled off, but it
increasing again now.  Belarus only reports statistics every two or
three days.
