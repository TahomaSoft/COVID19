  <LI>Confirmed cases in the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and
  Estonia have now peaked. This can be seen better on <a
  href="#rates-nordic">this graph.</a>

<LI>Latvia and Lithuania were on very similar curves; Lithuania peaked
on April 4th and Latvia on April 1st.  Lithuania has seen a surge in
new cases the last three days, and it seems likely the April 4th peak
will be exceeded.

<LI>Russia is experiencing a lower daily increase rate than most
  northern countries at the equivalent stage of the infection.  I've
  aligned it with the 22% daily increase curve that many countries
  followed.  Recently Russian has started to drop below the 22% curve.  Growth in Russia is still exponential.

<LI>Ukraine was growing at around the 35% rate that is typical of
countries early in the epidemic, then switched to a lower growth rate
the last week.  Ukraine has not yet peaked.

<LI>I don't understand why the Belarus curve levelled off, but it then
increased rapidly for three weeks. The last week the increase rate reduced substantially
but it is not clear yet if this is the peak.
