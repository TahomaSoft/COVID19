<LI>All the English regions converged onto the 35% daily increase
curve that Italy followed, then transitioned to the 22% daily increase
curve, though London and the Midlands spent longer at 35% than the
other regions.  Since then, all the regions have seen further reductions.  I have aligned all the regions except South West with the Italy curve at the point in which they reached 300 cases per million inhabitants.  This emphasizes recent differences in growth giving a better idea of where things are going, while deemphasizing older increases.

<LI>South West is the exception here, as the daily increase rate there
has been less than the rest of England for two weeks now.  I have
aligned South West with Italy at the point in which they reached 100
cases per million inhabitants.  Normally I prefer to align gradients
if two curves share a common gradient (i.e. increase rate) for a
while, but I cannot do this in this case.

<LI>London is running around a week ahead of the UK, and is tracking
along the curve that Italy followed (previously it looked like it was
tracking the Lombardy curve).  It looks like the daily increase rate
in London peaked on April 1st, with a second similar peak on April
5th, though it is too early to be sure that the rate will not increase
again.
