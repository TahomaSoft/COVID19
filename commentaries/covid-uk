<LI>Public Health England has changed the way confirmed cases are
reported.  Previously they were reported by the date test results were
available.  Now they are reported by the test sample date, which
removes some artifacts caused by reporting results in batches, but it
means that the results are not stable for several days.  As a result,
I am not showing the results for tests performed less than four days
ago.  By this time, the most of the results are in for tests performed
four or more days ago, though some do still trickle in after this
time.

<LI>All the English regions converged onto the 35% daily increase
curve that Italy followed, then transitioned to the 22% daily increase
curve, though London and the Midlands spent longer at 35% than the
other regions.  Since then, all the regions have seen further reductions.  I have aligned all the regions at the point in which they reached 200 cases per million inhabitants.  This emphasizes recent differences in growth giving a better idea of where things are going, while deemphasizing older increases.

<LI>London is running around a week ahead of the resst of the UK, and is tracking
along the curve that Italy followed.  It looks like the daily increase rate
in London peaked on April 2nd (as measured by samples taken that day).

<LI>North East England and the Midlands also look to have peaked.
This can be seen better on <a href="#rates-uk">this graph</a>.
