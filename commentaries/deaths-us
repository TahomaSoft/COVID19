<LI>Confirmed cases in the US have been growing very fast until
recently.  The US testing procedures were very slow to get started,
but have scaled up quickly.  How much of the rapid increase in case
data is due to this scale-up?  This graph shows the US death rate,
with Italy and France for comparison.  When looking at confirmed
cases, the US is roughly 14 days behind Italy, whereas when looking at
death rates, the US is roughly 21 days behind Italy.  This probably
indicates that part of the recent increases is indeed due to improved
testing, but the difference is nowhere near as large as Germany, so
the underlying infection rate must also be high.  This gap has
steadily widened over the last two weeks, so US testing is probably
continuing to improve.
