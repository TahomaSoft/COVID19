<LI>In the early days of the epidemic, two clusters are visible:
Washington State, California, Florida and Texas saw deaths grow at
around 22% per day, whereas most other states saw deaths grow at 35%
or more per day.

<LI>States in the former group have all seen death rates continue to
risk relatively slowly, and it appears their final death toll will be
comparatively low.

<LI>There is a wide range of outcomes for states in the latter
category.  Georgia, for example, saw a substantial decline in the
daily increase rate, and deaths there now appear to have peaked.

<LI>New York, New Jersey, Louisiana, Connecticut Michigan and
Massachusetts saw continued increases at around 35% per day for
longer than Italy did.  These states are now tracking above the Italy
track.  All these states may see higher death tolls per million
inhabitants than Italy did.

<LI>New York and New Jersey are tracking above the Spain curve.  The
final death toll per million inhabitants here is looking like it
will be the highest in the world.
