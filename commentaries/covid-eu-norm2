      <LI>Data for most Nordic countries showed large waves of
      imported cases, with increase rates above 35%, followed by a
      slump as the imports cease. Sometimes this is followed six or so
	days later by an echo of the original surge.
	
      <LI>Iceland suffered a large number of imported cases relative
      to its very small population.  After that burst stopped, Iceland
      followed roughly the same curve as Italy, two days ahead.  Two
      weeks days ago Iceland's increase rate increased for five days,
      but it then levelled off at a similar rate to Italy. It is
      possible that this increase was due to increased testing rather
      than a burst in new cases.  Iceland is now appears to have
      peaked, though the decline in new cases is relatively slow.
      
      <LI>Norway, Sweden, and Denmark all managed to stop the
      majority of imported cases from spreading too far, but
      afterwards they all restarted exponential growth from a smaller
      base of active cases, hence the relatively shallow gradients of
      their curves.

<LI>Norway peaked on March 27th, though the decrease since has not
been continuous.

<LI>Sweden and Denmark are showing signs that they may
peak shortly.

      <LI>Unlike other countries, Finland is now reporting confirmed
      cases data with the date that the test was performed rather than
      the date the test result was produced.  This means that
      confirmed cases for the last few days continue to rise as test
      results come in.  As a result, I am not displaying the last two
      days' results, as their results are incomplete and so they give
      a false impression of a downturn.  I am not yet sure if the
      downturn in the last few days that I am showing is genuine, or a
      result of late test results.

<LI>The Finland dataset is currently coming from <a
