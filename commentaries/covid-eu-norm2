      <LI>Data for most Nordic countries showed large waves of
      imported cases, with increase rates above 35%, followed by a
      slump as the imports cease. Sometimes this is followed six or so
	days later by an echo of the original surge.
	
      <LI>Iceland suffered a large number of imported cases relative
      to its very small population.  After that burst stopped, Iceland
      followed roughly the same curve as Italy, two days ahead.
      Twelve days ago Iceland's increase rate increased for five days,
      but it has now levelled off at a similar rate to Italy. It is
      possible that this increase was due to increased testing rather
      than a burst in new cases.  Iceland is now showing signs that it is peaking.
      
      <LI>Norway, Sweden, and Denmark all managed to stop the
      majority of imported cases from spreading too far, but
      afterwards they all restarted exponential growth from a smaller
      base of active cases, hence the relatively shallow gradients of
      their curves.  All these countries are showing signs that they
      may peak shortly.

      <LI>The data for Finland on previous verions of this graph is
      almost certainly incorrect as a result of late incorporation of
      old results that were not previously counted into the historic
      record, but I have not yet had time to understand precisely how
      this is incorrect. I have removed the curve for Finland until
      then.
