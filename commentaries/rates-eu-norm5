<LI>Estonia may have peaked, but the curve is so variable it is hard to be certain.

<LI>Latvia appears to have peaked on April 1st with a relatively
steady decline in new cases since then.

<LI>Lithuania may have peaked on April 4th, though it will take a few
more days to be sure, as the last two days show increases again.

<LI>Russia and Belarus are showing exponential increases. The recent
rapid increase in Belarus is close to the 35% daily increase rate seem
in many countries before effective isolation measures were put in
place.

<LI>The number of new cases per day in Ukraine is growing again after
a brief lull.  It is not clear yet whether this is a return to
exponential increases
