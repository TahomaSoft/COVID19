<LI>Estonia appears to have finally peaked for the last time, but the
curve has been so variable it is hard to be certain.  The last five
days have shown strong declines and cases are now at less than 20% of
the peak.

<LI>Latvia peaked on April 1st with the general trend since then being
downwards in a rather noisy manner with smaller peaks along the way.

<LI>Lithuania peaked on April 4th, with a strong decline until eight
days ago.  Since then though, there has been a surge of new cases
resulting in a second peak, but now cases are declining again.

<LI>Belarus had been showing exponential increases until recently. The
recent rapid increase in Belarus was close to the 35% daily increase
rate seem in many countries before effective isolation measures were
put in place.  The last week the number of new cases in Belarus each
day has suddently become relatively constant, but it's not yet clear if this is
the peak.

<LI>Russia had been showing constant exponential increase until three
days ago, but the last three days increased have been relatively
constant.  It is too early to know if this represents a peak.

<LI>The number of new cases per day in Ukraine had been growing again
after a brief lull 16 days ago followed exponential increases for a
week. The last few days shows a small decrease, but it is still too
early to know if Ukraine has peaked.
