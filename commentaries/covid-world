     <LI> The early part of the China curve is shown for
     comparison. I'm not sure how accurate the numbers are in the
     early stage because they didn't initially know what to look for,
     and the way of measuring changed part way through this period.
     The initial increase rate is fairly consistent with the 35% daily growth seen in
     Europe.

<LI>China and South Korea both had a high sustained increase rate, and
     then brought the virus under control, as seen in the level
     curves.

<LI>The USA tracked very closely along the 35% growth
     line, and did so for much longer than any other
     country. Confirmed cases in the worst affected US states now appear to be peaking.

<LI>Iran tracked a little above a 35% increase rate until four weeks
  ago.  Since then, Iran had experienced ten days of consistent 11.5%
  exponential growth, with the following ten days showing further
  decline.  For many days the daily increase in cases was roughly
  constant at around 1100-1200 new cases per day, but then i
  started to increase exponentially again.
  It is possible the constant phase was due to limitations in testing.  The last two weeks Iran new appears to be getting the epidemic under control again, and case appear to have peaked.

<LI>Japan is has been an enigma for a long time, with an extremely
  consistent 8.5% per day daily growth rate for many weeks, until a
  month ago weeks when it declined further, before rebounding
  significantly two weeks ago.  It seems more likely that early
  measures taken there were effective to some degree at reducing the
  increase rate, but are not sufficient to avoid exponential growth
  altogether.  There is some discussion that the historic figures for
  Japan may not have been accurate, but I won't speculate on this
  other than to note that the Japanese curve has always been an
  unusual outlier.  The last five days show a sudden decrease in new cases.
