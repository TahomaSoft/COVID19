<LI>Data on this graph comes directly from the <a
href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data">JHU
dataset</a>, or from the Wikipedia dataset which is often better
quality.  I have not double-checked the data, and it may lag by up to
a day.

<LI>Panama, Mexico and the Dominican Republic all seem to be following
the track paved by Italy, though they are at different stages along
this track.

<LI>In part, the reason Mexico is further behind is simply because it
has a larger population; as the outbreak is not evenly distributed,
this may underplay the severity in the outbreak clusters.
