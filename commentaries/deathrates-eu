<LI>The number of deaths per day appears to have peaked in Italy and
Spain.

<LI>The number of deaths per day is no longer growing exponentially
anywhere in Western Europe or Scandinavia.  Many countries are seeing
what appears to be the early stages of a reduction in daily deaths.

<LI>Although the number of new confirmed cases per day in Austria has
clearly peaked on March 27th, the number of deaths per day has
been slow to decline.  A similar pattern was seen in South
Korea, where the peak in the death rate was nearly a month after the
peak in the peak in new confirmed cases.

<LI>See the comment on the previous graph regarding the Belgian
numbers, and why the absolute values of these curves are in some
doubt.  However, any measurement differences will be within a factor
of two at most; they will not appear large on a logscale plot, so the
overall shape of the curves is not really in doubt.

<LI>I have removed Sweden from this graph, as the way deaths are
attributed to days makes it impossible to present in this form in a
way that is not misleading.
