<LI>The number of deaths per day appears to have peaked in Italy and
Spain.

<LI>The number of deaths per day is no longer growing exponentially
anywhere in Western Europe or Scandinavia.  Many countries are seeing
what appears to be the early stages of a reduction in daily deaths.

<LI>Although the number of new confirmed cases per day in Austria has
clearly peaked on March 27th, the number of deaths per day has
been slow to decline.  A similar pattern was seen in South
Korea, where the peak in the death rate was nearly a month after the
peak in the peak in new confirmed cases.

<LI>See the comment on the previous graph regarding the Belgian
numbers, and why the absolute values of these curves are in some
doubt.  However, any measurement differences will be within a factor
of two at most; they will not appear large on a logscale plot, so the
overall shape of the curves is not really in doubt.

<LI>Sweden seems unusual, not because the deaths per day have peaked,
but because the deaths peaked before the confirmed cases peaked.  The
UK also saw deaths peak on April 10th with confirmed cases peaking on
April 11th.  In the UK there was a change in testing strategy; if we
count only test results from hospitals, which is a consistent subset,
then the UK confirmed cases appear to have peaked on April 5th.  This
is more consistent with deaths peaking 6 days later.  Likely something
similar happened in Sweden.
