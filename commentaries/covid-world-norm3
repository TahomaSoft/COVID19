<LI>Turkey and Israel both appear to be tracking faithfully along the path blazed by Italy.

<LI>Until a week ago, Saudi Arabia was seeing 22% daily increases.  A
week ago there was a sudden change, and the last week, daily increases
have been averaged around 10%.
  
<LI>Pakistan initially saw very rapid rises, but the last eight days
has seen exponential increases with a substantially longer doubling
time.

<LI>I do not understand the South Africa data..  The very sudden
change from exponential growth at 35% per day to less than 5% growth
<B>seems very unlikely to reflect a real change in underlying
infections</B>.  No other country has shown such a sudden change from
one day to the next.  This change coincides with the start of a
lockdown, but cannot represent a reduction in infections <I>caused</I>
by the lockdown, as people who were infected the day before the
lockdown would not show symptoms sufficient to be tested for at least
a week, so cases would have continued to rise at the original rate for
a week.  Even if a lockdown were 100% effective, subsequent infections
within households would cause infections to continue to rise for many
days or even weeks.  I will refrain from speculating about the cause
of this sudden change in growth rate.
