<LI>Turkey and Israel both tracked closely along the path blazed by
Italy, but both have dropped below this curve recently.  Israel peaked
on April 2nd, and has shown steady decreases since.

<LI>Turkey has seen roughly constant daily increases of around 4000 cases per day since 

<LI>Until two weeks ago, Saudi Arabia was seeing 22% daily increases.  A
two weeks ago there was a sudden change, and since then daily increases
have averaged around 10%, though the last few days shows a slight increase again.
  
<LI>Pakistan initially saw very rapid rises, but the last two weeks
has seen exponential increases with a substantially longer doubling
time.

<LI>I do not understand the South Africa data..  The very sudden
change from exponential growth at 35% per day to less than 5% growth
on March 28th seemed very unlikely to reflect a real change in underlying
infections.  Since then new cases per day have crept back up again, with the largest number of new cases seen so far, 251, being recorded on April 18th.  The general trend has been a slow acceleration of new cases per day.
