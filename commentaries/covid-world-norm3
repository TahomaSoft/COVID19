<LI>Turkey and Israel both tracked closely along the path blazed by
Italy, but both have dropped below this curve recently.  Israel peaked
on April 2nd, and has shown steady decreases since.

<LI>Until two weeks ago, Saudi Arabia was seeing 22% daily increases.  A
two weeks ago there was a sudden change, and since then daily increases
have averaged around 10%.
  
<LI>Pakistan initially saw very rapid rises, but the last eight days
has seen exponential increases with a substantially longer doubling
time.

<LI>I do not understand the South Africa data..  The very sudden
change from exponential growth at 35% per day to less than 5% growth
<B>seems very unlikely to reflect a real change in underlying
infections</B>.  No other country has shown such a sudden change from
one day to the next.  This change coincides with the start of a
lockdown, but cannot represent a reduction in infections <I>caused</I>
by the lockdown, as people who were infected the day before the
lockdown would not show symptoms sufficient to be tested for at least
a week, so cases would have continued to rise at the original rate for
a week.  Even if a lockdown were 100% effective, subsequent infections
within households would cause infections to continue to rise for many
days or even weeks.  I will refrain from speculating about the cause
of this sudden change in growth rate.
