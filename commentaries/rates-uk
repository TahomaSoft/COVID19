<LI>All the data on this graph only include "pillar 1" data.  The
English data is reported by sample date (I am not showing the most
recent four days, as the data has not yet stabilized), whereas the
other country data is reported by the date the test results were
published.  The two styles of reporting are not completely comparable,
although it does not appear to make a great deal of difference on this
graph.

<LI>London, the Midlands, North East and North Westlook like they may have peaked.

<LI>All the other English regions  and Wales may
be peaking but it is too soon to know with confidence.  

<LI>Scotland and Northern Ireland have seen higher daily increases the
last few days, so may have not yet peaked.
