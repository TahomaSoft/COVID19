<LI>Some countries appear to be peaking, in that the number of new
cases per day stops growing exponentially and levels off.  But then it
doesn't start going back down quickly.  You can get a broad peak like
this:

<UL>

<LI>when you have multiple outbreaks in a country that are not
aligned in time: some are still growing while others are declining.

<LI>isolation methods have brought
the number of people each infected person passes COVID19 on to down to
almost exactly one, but this is unlikely.

<LI>if you're only testing severe cases and testing is
saturated, so the numbers only report the testing capacity.

</UL>

<LI>We can look at death rates data to try and rule out the third option.  Death rate data lags case data by 1-2 weeks, but we can see the start of a levelling in deaths in Switzerland and Luxembourg.  There have not been enough deaths in Iceland, Bulgaria or Slovakia to case any light on the issue, either way.
