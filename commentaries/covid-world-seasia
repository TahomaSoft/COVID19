  <LI>Data on this graph comes directly from the <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data">JHU dataset</a>.  I have not double-checked the data, and it may lag by up to a day.

<LI>I originally included a graph for Vietnam, Cambodia, Taiwan and
the Philippines, not because the situation there is bad, but because
the trend for each had started to look worrying.  Since then all these
countries have peaked, and the situation appears to be in control.

<LI>Philippines peaked on March 31st, with 538 cases that day, but has
declined since to around 25% of that level.

<LI>Vietnam and Cambodia have very low counts of new confirmed cases -
around one a day in Cambodia, and low single digits in Vietnam. It
seems likely that these rates are in part due to hot humid weather.
