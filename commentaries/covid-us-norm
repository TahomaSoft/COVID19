<LI>I am pulling data for this graph from
    the <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data">NYT
    dataset</a>, which is much less noisy than the JHU dataset I was
    previously using.

<LI>Many US states are a long way behind European countries, but
    several now have comparable rates per million inhabitants and New
    York, New Jersey and perhaps Louisiana are ahead. I have only plotted the 12
    states with most confirmed cases.

<LI>European countries moved from a 35% daily increase curve to a 22%
    daily increase curve, and then to a 13.5% curve as isolation
    measures started to work. In the last few days almost all the
    states I'm tracking have transitioned to the 13.5% curve so I have
    aligned them with the curve that Italy and France followed.

<LI>New York was growing at close to the 35% daily increase rate seen
    in Europe, but then had very large increases over a week.  This
    usually happens when cases have been spreading undetected and
    suddenly testing starts catching up. Since then the increase rate
    has declined significantly and in the last few days, cases in NY
    have been growing exponentially at the much lower rate of around
    13.5% per day.  I have placed New York so as to align it with the
    13.5% curve, though it is much further along that curve than
    either Italy or Lombardy reached.  As Italy seems to have peaked
    and New York has more cases per head of population than Italy, it
    makes no sense saying where New York is on Italy's track: New York
    is forming its own track.

<LI>New Jersey, Louisiana, Massachusetts and Michigan have tracked
further up the 13.5% curve than Italy did.  None of these states are
showing signs the exponential growth will end soon.
