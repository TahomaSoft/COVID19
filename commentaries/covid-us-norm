<LI>I am pulling data for this graph from
    the <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data">NYT
    dataset</a>, which is much less noisy than the JHU dataset I was
    previously using.

<LI>I have aligned the states by a 4.5% daily increase curve.  Italy
did not show sustained 4.5% increases, but a number of US states did
so, and aligning in this way shows more clearly how common their
growth rates are, or have recently been.

<LI>New York, Louisiana, Washington State and Oklahome have all
dropped below 4.5% daily increase rates.
