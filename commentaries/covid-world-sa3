<LI>Data on this graph comes directly from the <a
href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data">JHU
dataset</a>, or from the Wikipedia dataset which is often better
quality.  I have not double-checked the data, and it may lag by up to
a day.

<LI>South American countries seem to be clustered into two: Andean
states except for Columbia tracking roughly along the 22% daily
increase curve for some time, roughly following the track taken by
Italy.  The rest of South America seems to be fairing considerably
better, with lower overall numbers of cases and lower increase rates.
Growth is still exponential though.

<LI>The total number of confirmed cases in Venezuela is very small,
with daily increases being in the low single digits.

<LI>The daily increases in Uruguay are also low - in the last week
they have ranged from 6 cases to 32 cases.  The largest daily increase
was 36 cases, on March 27th.
