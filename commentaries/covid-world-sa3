<LI>Data on this graph comes directly from the <a
href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data">JHU
dataset</a>, or from the Wikipedia dataset which is often better
quality.  I have not double-checked the data, and it may lag by up to
a day.

<LI>South American countries seem to be clustered into two: Andean
states except for Columbia have recently been tracking roughly along
the 22% daily increase curve, roughly following the track taken by
Italy.  The rest of South America seems to be fairing considerably better, with lower overall numbers of cases and lower increase rates.  Growth is still exponential though.
