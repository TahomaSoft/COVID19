<LI>This linear-scale graph shows better than the log-scale graphs how
rapidly (or otherwise) cases drop off after the peak.  I've aligned
all the peaks together, and normalized the daily increases so the day
of maximum increase (after moderate smoothing) has value 1.  Where a
country had more than one peak within 90% of the same height, I've
aligned by the first one, as I'm interested in what happens once the
number of daily confirmed cases stops increasing.

<LI>Where a country essentially had a single outbreak, such as in
China or South Korea, once the outbreak is tackled effectively, the
cases can largely die back down within ten days of the peak.  But few
countries manage to achieve this, and double or triple peaks are
common.  There are likely to be a number of reasons for this ranging
from multiple outbreaks within a country peaking at different times to
mitigation measures not being completely effective.
