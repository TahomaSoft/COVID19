  <LI>Most warm countries do not have enough cases to establish a clear
  increase rate trend.  The graph shows number of confirmed case for
  some typical "cool" countries and some "warm" ones.  

<LI>India, Indonesia and Egypt are all warm countries and have all
    were experiencing roughly 14% daily growth.  The last few days
    Egypt and Indonesia have seen a significant decline in growth
    rate, and Egypt may be peaking, though we won't have confidence in
    this for a few more days.

<LI>Australia was on the 14% curve, but then switched to the 22%
  curve.  This appeared to correspond to temperatures reducing, but
  more analysis would be needed to know if this is significant.  Since
  then, Australia's daily confirmed case count <a
  href="#rates-peaked">has peaked</a>, then declined significantly.

<LI>Malaysia had been tracking close to 14%, but has not seen
exponential growth since March 16th.  Malaysia peaked either on March
26th or April 3rd (the two peaks are similar), but declines since have
been slow and it is possible another peak may still occur.

<LI>Brazil was tracking roughly along the 35% line for a while, which
seems to run counter to warm weather inhibiting the spread of the
virus, but recently it has moved to lower growth.  I have now aligned
Brazil with the 14% curve experience by other warm countries, and
Brazil has roughly followed this track for nearly three weeks.  Brazil
actually has both tropical and equatorial climate zones, so it unclear
how this should manifest in COVID-19 progression.

<LI> Bahrain and Kuwait have very low recent increase levels. This
  may indicate that most cases were imports, and that local spread has
  been effectively contained.

<LI>Qatar previously was following the same curve as Bahrain, but the
last week has increased suddenly to match the 14% daily increase rate
of Brazil.

<LI>Although Singapore has a warm climate, I have omitted it from this
  graph, because strong contact tracing there dwarfs any
  climate-dependent effect we might observe.

<LI>Vietnam and Cambodia are shown on <a
href="#covid-world-seasia">this graph</a>; both have warm humid
climates and very low recent growth.

<LI> In general, it does appear that COVID19 may spread more slowly in
  warm climates, but the evidence is inconclusive, and it appears to
  require relatively hot temperatures to have much effect.
