 <LI>In the other graphs I use a log scale on the y-axis because
    exponential growth gives a straight line on a log-linear graph,
    and this makes changes in the growth rates visible and allows
    exponential growth rates to be compared. However, many readers
    have told me they don't like log-linear graphs, so this one is for
    them.  It has to be truncated, or you cannot see any information.
    It doesn't really show anything additional over the log graphs,
    except it looks scarier and shows how much worse things are set to
    get if effective measures are not taken.

<LI>I have shown the China curve until the daily increase rate drops
    below 0.1%.  The glitch in the center of this curve is a change in
    measurement methodology.

<LI>Italy and France closely followed the Chinese curve during the exponential period, but both have taken longer to bring the epidemic under control. Both countries have peaked, but the decline is significantly slower than it was in China.

<LI>One thing this view shows well is how much of an outlier the US
   is - the faster increase rate of the US
   curve is self-evident. 
   
<LI>This view also makes clearer the recent restart of exponential
  growth in Iran, and its subsequent reduction.  It is unclear to me
  whether exponential growth actually had previously stopped in Iran,
  or whether the increase rate was simply limited by their testing
  capacity.  If it was the latter, then something about their process
  for confirming cases has changed.  New cases in Iran peaked on March 30th.

<LI>I have added Austria to this graph, as it is a western country
that has clearly peaked, showing almost as quick a decline in new cases as South Korea.
