 <LI>In the other graphs I use a log scale on the y-axis because
    exponential growth gives a straight line on a log-linear graph,
    and this makes changes in the growth rates visible and allows
    exponential growth rates to be compared. However, many readers
    have told me they don't like log-linear graphs, so this one is for
    them.  It has to be truncated, or you cannot see any information.
    It doesn't really show anything additional over the log graphs,
    except it looks scarier and shows how much worse things are set to
    get if effective measures are not taken.

<LI>I have shown the China curve until the daily increase rate drops
    below 0.1%.  The glitch in the center of this curve is a change in
    measurement methodology.

<LI>Italy closely followed the Chinese curve during the exponential period, but took longer to bring the epidemic under control. Italy is no longer rising exponentially, but new cases are not yet declining much either.

<LI>One thing this view shows well is how much of an outlier the US
   is - the faster increase rate of the US
   curve is self-evident. 
   
<LI>This view also makes clearer the recent restart of exponential
  growth in Iran, and its subsequent reduction.  It is unclear to me
  whether exponential growth actually had previously stopped in Iran,
  or whether the increase rate was simply limited by their testing
  capacity.  If it was the latter, then something about their process
  for confirming cases has changed.

<LI>I have added Austria to this graph, as it is the western country
that most clearly appears to have peaked.  If this is the case, it
should trend in a similar way to South Korea, although it is not clear
if the decline in new cases will be as quick in Austria as it was in
South Korea.
