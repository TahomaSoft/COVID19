<LI>England (excluding London), Scotland, Wales and Northern Island
were all experiencing daily increase rates close to the 22% curve that
Italy followed, then followed the 13.5% curve that Italy also
followed. I have aligned by this 8% curve that Italy followed shortly
before peaking.  In the last three weeks all have experienced
continued declines in the daily percentage increase (though not
declines in the absolute number of new cases), though Wales took
longer to make this transition, so now has a larger number of cases
per million inhabitants than England, Scotland or Northern Ireland.

<LI> Once daily increases get this low, it is hard to distinguish
exponential increases from constant increases, so the next graph may
provide a clearer view.
