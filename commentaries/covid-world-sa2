<LI>Data on this graph comes directly from the <a
href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data">JHU
dataset</a>, or from the Wikipedia dataset which is often better
quality.  I have not double-checked the data, and it may lag by up to
a day.

<LI>South American countries seem to be clustered into two: Andean
states except for Columbia have  tracked roughly along
the 22% daily increase curve, roughly following the track taken by
Italy.  This trend stopped about two weeks ago in most countries.

<LI>New cases in Argentina appear to have peaked on April 2nd, but do
seem to have declined greatly since, so it is possible they may start
increasing again.

<LI>New cases in Chile were fairly constant for about a week, but have
been climbing again the last three days.

<LI>The curves for Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador are all rather noisy.
The Ecuador curve in particular is sufficiently noisy that it casts
doubt on how accurately it is tracking the underlying infections, as
the infection process at this scale is unlikely to be this variable.
