<LI>Luxembourg is such an outlier in the previous graph that this
leads me to doubt that the confirmed case data is comparable with
other countries.  The number of deaths in Luxembourg is very small -
only 44 as of 8th April - but it's just enough that we can get a very rough
cross-calibration of case data vs death data.  It seems likely that
testing in Luxembourg is much more effective than in France or Italy,
and so is identifying many more people whose symptoms would be too
mild to merit testing in France or Germany.  It is clear that there
are a large number of cases in Luxembourg, but not so many more per
million inhabitants as the previous graph shows.  It looks like deaths
lag case data by about ten days more in Luxembourg than in France.
The German data shows a similar additional lag.
