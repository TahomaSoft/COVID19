<LI>Some countries appear to be peaking, in that the number of new
cases per day stops growing exponentially and levels off.  But then it
doesn't start going back down quickly.  You can get a broad peak like
this when you have multiple outbreaks in a country that are not
aligned in time: some are still growing while others are declining.
You can also get a peak like this if isolation methods have brought
the number of people each infected person passes COVID19 on to down to
almost exactly one, but this is unlikely.  You can also get a peak
like this if you're only testing severe cases and testing is
saturated, so the numbers only report the testing capacity.
