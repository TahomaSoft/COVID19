       <LI>I normally use a log scale on the y-axis because
     exponential growth gives a straight line on a log-linear graph.
     This allows exponential growth rates to be compared. However,
     many readers don't like log-linear graphs, so this one is for
     them.  It has to be truncated, or you cannot see any information.
     It doesn't really show anything additional over the log graphs,
     except it looks scarier.  

<LI><B>Be careful using this graph for prediction purposes</B>.  Conclusions
you may draw from the trajectory on logscale graphs are much less
sensitive to the fraction of infections being detected than on this
linear graph.  For example, if the UK was detecting 10% of cases and
Spain was detecting 15% of cases, their trajectories would appear
similar on this graph.  On a logscale graph, the gradient is not
affected by constant multiplicative differences in detection rate.
