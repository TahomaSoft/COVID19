<LI>Data on this graph comes directly from the <a
href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data">JHU
dataset</a>, or from the Wikipedia dataset which is often better
quality.  I have not double-checked the data, and it may lag by up to
a day.

<LI>South American countries seem to be clustered into two: Andean
states except for Columbia have recently been tracking roughly along
the 22% daily increase curve, roughly following the track taken by
Italy.

<LI>Cases in Ecuador were increasing significantly faster than 35% per
day until a week ago.  This usually indicates that the epidemic has
spread without being detected, and testing is now catching up.  For
the last week, increase rates declined significantly, to less than
15%.
