<LI>On this graph I show the countries that I believe have likely
peaked, and I have aligned the day they peaked at day 0.

<LI>It doesn't really make sense to show Chinese cases per million
inhabitants, when 82% of the cases were in Hubei province.  I have
therefore used the Hubei population as the China population when
calculating cases per million inhabitants.  Really all I care about on
this graph is the shape of the curve.

<LI>It is notable that China and Korea rose faster to their peaks and
declined faster from their peaks than western countries.

<LI>Italy's peak appears to be rather broad.  In part this may be due
to a large increase in testing just after the time of the peak, which
might give the impression cases are not falling as fast as they really
are.

<LI>New Zealand appears to be exhibiting a broad peak, similar to a
number of European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands.


<LI>Finland was previously on this graph, but no longer looks to have peaked.
