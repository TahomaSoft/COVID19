<LI>On this graph I show some of the earlier countries that peaked,
and I have aligned the day they peaked at day 0.  Although the
logscale makes it hard to see how far cases have declined, it allows
us to see both the height of the peaks and the time taken to decline
on the same graph.  

<LI>It doesn't really make sense to show Chinese cases per million
inhabitants, when 82% of the cases were in Hubei province.  I have
therefore used the Hubei population as the China population when
calculating cases per million inhabitants.  Really all I care about on
this graph is the shape of the curve.

<LI>It is notable that China and Korea rose faster to their peaks and
declined faster from their peaks than western countries.

<LI>Italy's peak appears to be rather broad.  In part this may be due
to a large increase in testing just after the time of the peak, which
might give the impression cases are not falling as fast as they really
are.
