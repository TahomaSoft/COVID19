<LI>Generally, trends are easier to see on a cumulative plot, as
changes are inherently more noisy.  However, this view is better
to see whether a country has peaked or not.

<LI>Daily increases in absolute numbers were nearly constant for
several weeks in Luxembourg and Iceland.  Both countries now seem to
have peaked but the decrease is rather slow.

<LI>Several days ago, Finland looked like it had peaked.  I'm currently
unable to understand what has happened with the Finish data.  I am
led to believe it now includes some older data, but I have not yet
understood how this data was integrated into the historic record.  As
a result I have removed Finland from the graph until I find time to
understand what is really happening.

<LI>Norway was growing exponentially until 26th March, then decreased
for six days. This was followed by three days of modest increases again, followed again by decline;
these waves against a relatively static background level seems to be a
common feature in the Nordic region. It seems likely that Norway did in fact peak on 26th March.

<LI>Denmark and Sweden have very similar exponential increase rate
profiles for the last two weeks. Neither country is yet showing clear
signs of having peaked, but both may be near to doing so.

<LI>In mid March, Estonia looked like it had peaked, but this
behaviour has happened in other countries such as Denmark, where a
large number of case are imported.  The imported cases are mostly
tracked down, leading to a dip, then growth again as transmission that
was missed grows.  The peak 14 days ago may be an echo of the original
imported peak - this happened in Denmark and Sweden too, though their
echoes were less pronounced.  6 days ago another wave of cases
occurred, and now cases have dropped off again.  It is not clear
whether another echo of the previous peak will occur, or whether cases
will now decline.
