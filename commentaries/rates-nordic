<LI>Generally, trends are easier to see on a cumulative plot, as
changes are inherently more noisy.  However, this view is better
to see whether a country has peaked or not.

<LI>Daily increases in absolute numbers have been nearly constant for
several days in Luxembourg and Iceland.  This is likely to an indication
that the infection rate in these countries is peaking, though we won't
be sure until it has been going down again for more than a week.
Certainly, exponential growth is no longer occurring in these
countries.

<LI>Several days ago, Finland looked like it had peaked.  I'm currently
unable to understand what has happened with the Finish data.  I am
led to believe it now includes some older data, but I have not yet
understood how this data was integrated into the historic record.  As
a result I have removed Finland from the graph until I find time to
understnd what is really happening.

<LI>Norway was growing exponentially until 26th March, then decreased
for six days. The last three days have shown modest increases again;
these waves against a relatively static background level seems to be a
common feature in the Nordic region.

<LI>Denmark and Sweden have very similar exponential increase rate
profiles for the last two weeks. Neither country is yet showing clear signs of peaking.

<LI>In mid March, Estonia looked like it had peaked, but this
behaviour has happened in other countries such as Denmark, where a
large number of case are imported.  The imported cases are mostly
tracked down, leading to a dip, then growth again as transmission that
was missed grows.  The peak seven days ago may be an echo of the
original imported peak - this happened in Denmark and Sweden too,
though their echoes were less pronounced.  The last three data points
seem to indicate another wave of cases is in progress; whether this
wave is higher than the previous one is not yet clear.
