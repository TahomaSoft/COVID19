    <font color="red">Updated: 9th April 2020, 03:35 BST <B>All graphs
    have been updated, and I've added new graphs looking at the shape
    of the peak and looking at US states that may be peaking now.
    I've updated the commentary for all 19 European graphs, but not many
    of the others.  

<P>In general, quite a few countries are showing signs have having peaked (number of new confirmed cases per day is now decreasing), and a few are showing signs that the death rate has also peaked. MJH</B></font>

This page presents historical SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection
information.  I try to present it in a way that helps inform about how
the virus is progressing throughout the main outbreaks worldwide in a
way that allows countries to be compared and perhaps lessons learned.
The underlying infection and containment processes are complicated,
and conclusions you or I may draw from these graphs are not true
predictions.  For that, you'd need much more data about what is being
done in each country, and about how the data is collected. Comments
are my interpretation only.  Nevertheless, I hope you find it useful.

<LI>Certain increase rates: 35%, 22%, 13.5% and 8% really stand out in
  the data, as each country has settled on these rates for a while at
  different phases of the epidemic. I don't have any good
  justification for why these specific increase rates exist as strong
  features of the data, but they do appear to be quite prominent at
  the relative phases of the epidemic.  Likely they are related to
  various levels of social distancing performed by these countries.

<LI>On this graph I show the confirmed cases for Western European
countries, with the curves aligned at the point when each had just
transitioned from 35% daily increases to 22% daily increases.  This
view highlights the differences between countries, but is less useful

similarities, so I will reserve discussion of the individual curves for

</UL>

<LI> In contrast to graph 1, which highlights any divergence, <B>on this
graph I'm showing these countries aligned with the 8% curve</B> as all
of them now appear to have left both the 22% and 13.5% curves.  I'm also showing a shorter time interval.

<LI>Italy followed the 8% curve for about five days before
peaking. Italy has now dropped off of exponential increases and the
daily increase count appears to have peaked, though it has not declined greatly..

<LI> For the last week France and Germany both appear to have been
tracking close to the 8% daily increase curve that Italy followed.
Once increases get this small, it is hard to distinguish constant
increases from exponential increases on this graph.  France appears now to have peaked about 8 days ago.
In the case of Germany, the daily increase in cases has been
relatively constant, though it is not yet clear whether this represents
a peak.

<LI>The UK continues to follow most closely behind France, about 6
days behind.  In general the UK curves have most closely resembled
France for several weeks, so if the UK continues to do so, it should
now be peaking.

<LI> The Netherlands roughly followed the 8% curve for five days, but
the last two days show lower increases. It is starting to look like
cases in the Netherlands may have peaked 10 days ago, but the decrease rate since has been relatively show.

<LI>Switzerland has a relatively small population, and so the number
    of cases per million inhabitants is much higher.  Switzerland is
    shown with no time offset to Italy.  
    
  <LI> See the <a href="#deaths-eu-norm">this death rates graph</a>
    for why I am not confident in this placement for Switzerland. From
    that graph Switzerland looks to be as much as 10 days behind
    Italy.

  <LI> For more than two weeks now, Switzerland has seen roughly constant daily
  increases, which suggests Switzerland may have peaked, but is declining slowly since. 
    
  <LI>Spain stayed at 35% daily increases for much longer than any
    other large European country, which caused it to close on Italy,
    then followed the 22% curve for a week. Spain only roughly aligned
    with the 13.5% curve, although it joined this curve at roughly the
    point where Italy departed it.  For the last two weeks the number
    of new cases in Spain was roughly constant, with the last four 
    days showing a marked decrease.  Spain how appears to have peaked about a week ago.

  <LI>Austria followed the Lombardy curve pretty faithfully about ten
  days behind, staying at a higher increase rate for longer than
  Italy.  Austria peaked ten days ago, and, unlike Italy, Austria has
  seen a pronounced decrease in new cases since.

<LI>On this graph I show the countries that I believe have likely
peaked, and I have aligned the day they peaked at day 0.

<LI>It doesn't really make sense to show Chinese cases per million
inhabitants, when 82% of the cases were in Hubei province.  I have
therefore used the Hubei population as the China population when
calculating cases per million inhabitants.  Really all I care about on
this graph is the shape of the curve.

<LI>It is notable that China and Korea rose faster to their peaks and
declined faster from their peaks than western countries.

<LI>Finland was previously on this graph, but no longer looks to have peaked.</UL>

<LI>Some countries appear to be peaking, in that the number of new

doesn't start going back down quickly.  You can get a broad peak like
this:

<UL>

<LI>when you have multiple outbreaks in a country that are not

<LI>isolation methods have brought
the number of people each infected person passes COVID19 on to down to
almost exactly one, but this is unlikely.

<LI>if you're only testing severe cases and testing is
saturated, so the numbers only report the testing capacity.

</UL>

<LI>We can look at death rates data to try and rule out the third option.  Death rate data lags case data by 1-2 weeks, but we can see the start of a levelling in deaths in Switzerland and Luxembourg.  There have not been enough deaths in Iceland, Bulgaria or Slovakia to case any light on the issue, either way.</UL>

<LI>Spain, Germany and the Netherlands all hint at peaking the
last few days, but it's too early to say so with confidence.  

<LI>France has been following Italy pretty closely, and on that basis should peak within the next week.

<LI>I would expect the UK to not peak for another one to two weeks.
Generally the UK has been following France around a week behind.

<LI>The US and New Zealand are not technically in Western Europe, but I've added them here to aid comparision. 

<LI>The very rapid increase rate in the US appears to have tailed off,
but I suspect it has some way to go before peaking.  As the epidemic
is at different stages in different states, the US curve is less
likely to show a sharp peak when it does occur.  The last two weeks of
the US curve show strong similarities to the equivalent phase of the
Italian curve.

<LI>New Zealand appears to be exhibiting a broad peak, similar to a
number of European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands.

  Holt-Winters moving average filter with constants &alpha;=0.5 and

<LI>This linear-scale graph shows better than the log-scale graphs how
rapidly (or otherwise) cases drop off after the peak.  I've aligned
all the peaks together, and normalized the daily increases so the day
of maximum increase (after moderate smoothing) has value 1.  Where a
country had more than one peak within 90% of the same height, I've
aligned by the first one, as I'm interested in what happens once the
number of daily confirmed cases stops increasing.

<LI>Where a country essentially had a single outbreak, such as in
China or South Korea, once the outbreak is tackled effectively, the
cases can largely die back down within ten days of the peak.  But few
countries manage to achieve this, and double or triple peaks are
common.  There are likely to be a number of reasons for this ranging
from multiple outbreaks within a country peaking at different times to
mitigation measures not being completely effective.

<LI>The graph shows cumulative number of <B>deaths per million
      inhabitants</B>, plotted on a log scale, against time.  The
      country curves are shown offset by the amounts shown.</LI>
    <LI> As different countries have different testing policies, many
      people have suggested that we should look at deaths instead.
      There are several downsides to using deaths as a metric.  First,
      if the purpose of these graphs is to provide warning of what is
      to come, or to verify whether measure are working, deaths is not
      very useful.  Death rate is too low to provide a warning signal
      in advance of there being a problem, and it is not a good early
      indicator of whether measures are working because it lags case
      data by between one and two weeks.  It can, however, provide
      some insight into what fraction of infections are being detected
      in different countries.  Generally, if a country is further
      behind in this graph than in the equivalent cases graph, then
      the country is probably catching a larger fraction of cases.
      This is particularly pronounced in the case of Germany.
    <LI>
      Death data is also problematic because deaths per day does not
      go down quickly when cases go down.  This is particularly clear
      in the Korean data, where the death rate has remained nearly
      constant for three weeks after new infections peaked.
    <LI>
      Finally, when a healthcare system gets overwhelmed, death rate
      goes up from something like 0.9% (Korea) to something like 3-4%
      (Hubei, parts of Lombardy).
    <LI>
      Generally when cases are increasing exponentially, most
      countries' death rate curves shadow the cases curve, with a lag
      of between 6 (France, UK) and 12 days (Germany).  Spain, France,
      Netherlands and the UK look very similar to how they looked using
      case data around 6 days ago.  Germany is about ten days further
      back on this graph.  The difference in
      per-capita testing rates does not seem to explain this
      difference.

<LI>In the last few days, the UK and France have seen more deaths than
Italy did at a similar point in the epidemic, whereas Switzerland has
seem fewer deaths.

      <LI>Data for most Nordic countries showed large waves of
      imported cases, with increase rates above 35%, followed by a
      slump as the imports cease. Sometimes this is followed six or so
	days later by an echo of the original surge.
	
      <LI>Iceland suffered a large number of imported cases relative
      to its very small population.  After that burst stopped, Iceland
      followed roughly the same curve as Italy, two days ahead.  Two
      weeks days ago Iceland's increase rate increased for five days,
      but it then levelled off at a similar rate to Italy. It is
      possible that this increase was due to increased testing rather
      than a burst in new cases.  Iceland is now appears to have
      peaked, though the decline in new cases is relatively slow.
      
      <LI>Norway, Sweden, and Denmark all managed to stop the
      majority of imported cases from spreading too far, but
      afterwards they all restarted exponential growth from a smaller
      base of active cases, hence the relatively shallow gradients of
      their curves.

<LI>Norway peaked on March 27th, though the decrease since has not
been continuous.

<LI>Sweden and Denmarks are showing signs that they may
peak shortly.

      <LI>Unlike other countries, Finland is now reporting confirmed
      cases data with the date that the test was performed rather than
      the date the test result was produced.  This means that
      confirmed cases for the last few days continue to rise as test
      results come in.  As a result, I am not displaying the last two
      days' results, as their results are incomplete and so they give
      a false impression of a downturn.  I am not yet sure if the
      downturn in the last few days that I am showing is genuine, or a
      result of late test results.

<LI>The graph shows <B>daily increase in confirmed cases                                                                                   per million inhabitants</B>, plotted on a log scale, against time.
  A Holt-Winters moving average filter with constants &alpha;=0.5 and
  &beta;=0.5 has been applied to smooth the curves as differences are
  very noisy.  This is a moderate amount of smoothing and it imposes a
  about a days lag, but it does extract trends fairly well.  The
  curves are not offset, today is Day 0 for all curves.</LI>
<LI>Generally, trends are easier to see on a cumulative plot, as
changes are inherently more noisy.  However, this view is better
to see whether a country has peaked or not.

<LI>Daily increases in absolute numbers were nearly constant for
several weeks in Luxembourg and Iceland.  Both countries now seem to
have peaked but the decrease is rather slow.

<LI>Several days ago, Finland looked like it had peaked.  I'm currently
unable to understand what has happened with the Finish data.  I am
led to believe it now includes some older data, but I have not yet
understood how this data was integrated into the historic record.  As
a result I have removed Finland from the graph until I find time to
understnd what is really happening.

<LI>Norway was growing exponentially until 26th March, then decreased
for six days. This was followed by three days of modest increases again, followed again by decline;
these waves against a relatively static background level seems to be a
common feature in the Nordic region. It seems likely that Norway did in fact peak on 26th March.

<LI>Denmark and Sweden have very similar exponential increase rate
profiles for the last two weeks. Neither country is yet showing clear
signs of having peaked, but both may be near to doing so.

<LI>In mid March, Estonia looked like it had peaked, but this
behaviour has happened in other countries such as Denmark, where a
large number of case are imported.  The imported cases are mostly
tracked down, leading to a dip, then growth again as transmission that
was missed grows.  The peak 14 days ago may be an echo of the original
imported peak - this happened in Denmark and Sweden too, though their
echoes were less pronounced.  6 days ago another wave of cases
occured, and now cases have dropped off again.  It is not clear
whether another echo of the previous peak will occur, or whether cases
will now decline.

<LI>Ireland, Portugal and Belgium all appear to be roughly following
the curve that Italy followed.  In the last week it appears that
Portugal and Ireland are tracking slightly below the Italy curve and
Belgium is tracking slightly above the Italy curve.

<LI>Luxembourg has a very small population, so the curve is noisy.
      However, the last three weeks have taken Luxembourg well above
      the point even Lombardy reached at this stage of the infection.
      As a result I am not showing any time offset between the
      Luxembourg and Italy curves.  However, see the next graph for
      why I am not confident Luxembourg really is quite so close
      behind Italy as this graph would suggest.  Likely the large
      number of cases reported is due to better testing in Luxembourg.

<LI>Luxembourg is such an outlier in the previous graph that this
leads me to doubt that the confirmed case data is comparable with
other countries.  The number of deaths in Luxembourg is very small -
only 44 as of 8th April - but it's just enough that we can get a very rough
cross-calibration of case data vs death data.  It seems likely that
testing in Luxembourg is much more effective than in France or Italy,
and so is identifying many more people whose symptoms would be too
mild to merit testing in France or Germany.  It is clear that there
are a large number of cases in Luxembourg, but not so many more per
million inhabitants as the previous graph shows.  It looks like deaths
lag case data by about ten days more in Luxembourg than in France.
The German data shows a similar additional lag.

<LI>I thought Slovakia had peaked 16 days ago, then again 7 days ago,
but it appears I was wrong in both cases.  The increase in new cases
the last three days after such a long period of constant growth is
unusual, but I do not know if this is causes by better testing or an
increase in the underlying epidemic.

<LI>Increase are roughly level in Bulgaria, which appears to have

  had been nearly constant for two weeks, and has turned down more
  significantly the last few days.

<LI> Slovenia and the Czech Republic both appear to have peaked on

  <LI>Estonia's small population and recent fast ramp up of cases
  means it now has a high number of cases per million inhabitants. The
  current curve is similar to the Danish data, where most of a wave of
  imported cases was tracked down and exponential growth resumed from
  a lower base.  Estonia now looks to be peaking, but this is not
  certain, and can be seen better on <a href="#rates-nordic">this
  graph.</a>

<LI>Russia is experiencing a lower daily increase rate than most
  northern countries at the equivalent stage of the infection.  I've
  aligned it with the 22% daily increase curve that many countries
  followed.  Recently Russian looks to starting to drop below the 22% curve.

<LI>Latvia and Lithuania are on very similar curves; both look like
they peaked recently, Lithuania on April 4th and Latvia on April 1st,
though it will take a few more days to be confident about this.

<LI>Ukraine was growing at around the 35% rate that is typical of
countries early in the epidemic, then switched to a lower growth rate
the last week.  If the last two data points are continued, Ukraine may
be peaking, but it is too early to be sure.

       <LI>I normally use a log scale on the y-axis because
     exponential growth gives a straight line on a log-linear graph.
     This allows exponential growth rates to be compared. However,

<LI>South West is the exception here, as the daily increase rate there

     <LI> The early part of the China curve is shown for
     comparison. I'm not sure how accurate the numbers are in the
     early stage because they didn't initially know what to look for,
     and the way of measuring changed part way through this period.
     The initial increase rate is fairly consistent with the 35% daily growth seen in
     Europe.

<LI>Other than China, South Korea is the only country to have had a
     high sustained increase rate, and then bring the virus under
     control.

<LI>The USA tracked very closely along the 35% growth
     line, and did so for much longer than any other
     country. Testing in the US was initially very limited, but
     recently it seems testing has been catching up somewhat. In the
     last five days the US has shown the first signs of dropping off of
     the 35% daily increase curve.

<LI>Cases in the US are concentrated in a few states, in a
     similar way to how cases in Italy are concentrated in
     Lombardy.

<LI>Iran tracked a little above a 35% increase rate until four weeks
  ago.  Since then, Iran had experienced ten days of consistent 11.5%
  exponential growth, with the following ten days showing further
  decline.  For many days the daily increase in cases was roughly
  constant at around 1100-1200 new cases per day, but it has now
  started to increase exponentially again, now at around 8% per day.
  It is possible the constant phase was due to limitations in testing.

<LI>Japan is has been an enigma for a long time, with an extremely
  consistent 8.5% per day daily growth rate for many weeks, until two
  weeks when it has declined further, before rebounding significantly
  in the last few days.  It seems more likely that early measures
  taken there were effective to some degree at reducing the increase
  rate, but are not sufficient to avoid exponential growth altogether.
  There is some discussion that the historic figures for Japan may not
  have been accurate, but I won't speculate on this other than to note
  that the Japanese curve has always been an unusual outlier.</UL>

  <LI> Showing cases per million inhabitants does not greatly change

<LI>In this view, the US moves a few days further behind Italy.  This
  is probably deceptive, and it might be better to show data for
  New York State, for example, on this graph.

<LI>I've added a curve for Singapore, which contained the initial
  imported cases very well through contact tracing.  However the graph
  shows a worrying slow but steady super-exponential growth until
  about a week ago.  This growth was due in part to contact tracing
  losing its effectiveness, and recently Singapore announced more
  isolation measures as the number of untraced cases was rising.

<LI>I have added a curve for Australia, which appears to be in the
early stages of peaking.  If this continues, the curve will continue
to curve downwards to eventually parallel the Korean curve.

<LI>Most US states are a long way behind European countries, but

    York and perhaps New Jersey are ahead. I have only plotted the 11
    states with most confirmed cases.

<LI>European countries moved from a 35% daily increase curve to a 22%
    daily increase curve, and then to a 13.5% curve as isolation
    measures started to work. In the last few days almost all the
    states I'm tracking have transitioned to the 13.5% curve so I have
    aligned them with the curve that Italy and France followed.

<LI>New York was growing at close to the 35% daily increase rate seen
    in Europe, but then had very large increases over a week.  This
    usually happens when cases have been spreading undetected and
    suddenly testing starts catching up. Since then the increase rate
    has declined significantly and in the last few days, cases in NY
    have been growing exponentially at the much lower rate of around
    13.5% per day.  I have placed New York so as to align it with the
    13.5% curve, though it is much further along that curve than
    either Italy or Lombardy reached.  As Italy seems to have peaked
    and New York has more cases per head of population than Italy, it
    makes no sense saying where New York is on Italy's track: New York
    is forming its own track.

<LI>New Jersey, Louisiana, Massachusetts and Michigan have tracked
further up the 13.5% curve than Italy did.  None of these states are

<LI>Turkey and Israel both appear to be tracking faithfully along the path blazed by Italy.

<LI>Until a week ago, Saudi Arabia was seeing 22% daily increases.  A
week ago there was a sudden change, and the last week, daily increases
have been averaged around 10%.
  
<LI>Pakistan initially saw very rapid rises, but the last eight days
has seen exponential increases with a substantially longer doubling
time.

<LI>I do not understand the South Africa data..  The very sudden
change from exponential growth at 35% per day to less than 5% growth
<B>seems very unlikely to reflect a real change in underlying
infections</B>.  No other country has shown such a sudden change from
one day to the next.  This change coincides with the start of a
lockdown, but cannot represent a reduction in infections <I>caused</I>
by the lockdown, as people who were infected the day before the
lockdown would not show symptoms sufficient to be tested for at least
a week, so cases would have continued to rise at the original rate for
a week.  Even if a lockdown were 100% effective, subsequent infections
within households would cause infections to continue to rise for many
days or even weeks.  I will refrain from speculating about the cause
of this sudden change in growth rate.</UL>

<LI>Confirmed cases in the US have been growing very fast recently.
The US testing procedures were very slow to get started, but are
reported to have scaled up quickly.  How much of the rapid increase in
case data is due to this scale-up?  This graph shows the US death
rate, with Italy and France for comparison.  When looking at confirmed
cases, the US is roughly 15 days behind Italy, whereas when looking at
death rates, the US is roughly 19 days behind Italy.  This probably
indicates that a small part of the recent increases is indeed due to
improved testing, but the difference is nowhere near as large as
Germany or Luxembourg, so the underlying infection rate must also be
high.  If this gap widens in the future, then this would be evidence
  that testing is getting ahead of the epidemic.
  <LI> To put this in perspective if Italy is identifying just the ~10% of infections that need ICU care, the US is probably identifying very roughly ~30% of infections. (1.35 ^ 4 ~= 3)

<LI>The graph shows <B>cumulative number of confirmed cases</b>, plotted on a log
scale, against time.  The country curves are shown offset by the
amounts shown. </LI>
  <LI>Most warm countries do not have enough cases to establish a clear
  increase rate trend.  The graph shows number of confirmed case for
  some typical "cool" countries and some "warm" ones.  

<LI>India, Indonesia and Egypt are all warm countries and have all
    been experiencing roughly 14% daily growth.  The last few days
    Egypt has seen a significant decline in growth rate.

<LI>Australia used to be on the 14% curve, but three weeks ago it
  switched to the 22% curve.  The mean daytime
  temperature in Sydney for the five days before March 3rd (17 days
  ago) was 28.6C, whereas for the five days after March 3rd it was
  23.8C.  More analysis is needed to know if this is significant.
  There is no equivalent warming associated with the most recent
  reduction in daily growth, so this is likely to be related to social
  distancing measures. Australia now looks like it <a href="#rates-peaked"has peaked</a>.

<LI>Malaysia had been tracking close to 14%, but the last ten days seems
to have transitioned to around 5-6% growth.

<LI>Brazil was tracking roughly along the 35% line for a while, which
seems to run counter to warm weather inhibiting the spread of the
virus, but recently it has moved to lower growth.  I have now aligned
Brazil with the 14% curve experience by other warm countries, though
the fit is imperfect.  Brazil actually has both tropical and
equatorial climate zones, so it clear how this should manifest in
COVID-19 progression.

<LI> Bahrain and Kuwait have very low recent increase levels. This
  may indicate that most cases were imports, and that local spread has
  been effectively contained.

<LI>Qatar previously was following the same curve as Bahrain, but the last week has increased suddently to match the 14% daily increase rate of Brazil.

<LI>Although Singapore has a warm climate, I have omitted it from this
  graph, because strong contact tracing there dwarfs any
  climate-dependent effect we might observe.

<LI> In general, it does appear that COVID19 may spread more slowly in
  warm climates, but the evidence is inconclusive, and it appears to
  require relatively hot temperatures to have much effect.

<LI>The graph shows <b>number of confirmed cases</b>, plotted on a
linear scale, against time.  The country curves are shown offset
by the amounts shown.</LI>

 <LI>In the other graphs I use a log scale on the y-axis because
    exponential growth gives a straight line on a log-linear graph,
    and this makes changes in the growth rates visible and allows
    exponential growth rates to be compared. However, many readers
    have told me they don't like log-linear graphs, so this one is for
    them.  It has to be truncated, or you cannot see any information.
    It doesn't really show anything additional over the log graphs,
    except it looks scarier and shows how much worse things are set to
    get if effective measures are not taken.

<LI>I have shown the China curve until the daily increase rate drops
    below 0.1%.  The glitch in the center of this curve is a change in
    measurement methodology.

<LI>Italy closely followed the Chinese curve during the exponential period, but took longer to bring the epidemic under control. Italy is no longer rising exponentially, but new cases are not yet declining much either.

<LI>One thing this view shows well is how much of an outlier the US
   is - the faster increase rate of the US
   curve is self-evident. 
   
<LI>This view also makes clearer the recent restart of exponential
  growth in Iran, and its subsequent reduction.  It is unclear to me
  whether exponential growth actually had previously stopped in Iran,
  or whether the increase rate was simply limited by their testing
  capacity.  If it was the latter, then something about their process
  for confirming cases has changed.

<LI>I have added Austria to this graph, as it is the western country
that most clearly appears to have peaked.  If this is the case, it
should trend in a similar way to South Korea, although it is not clear
if the decline in new cases will be as quick in Austria as it was in
South Korea.

<P><B>Q: Can I have your data?</B>
  <P>My data is <a href="https://github.com/mhandley/COVID19/">on github</a>.
  <P>A more complete dataset is the <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series">Johns Hopkins</a> one. It tends to lag the national data sources and the WHO, but it is complete and machine readable.

  <P><B>Q: Can I use your graphs?</B>
  <P>
    Yes, they're under a CC0 "No rights reserved" license.  You can
    use them for any purpose.  I'd prefer you link back here though,
    as the explanations add important context.

  <P><B>Q: Different countries are testing at different rates.  How can you compare the data?</B>
    <P>So long as the fraction of actual cases being detected does
    not change, this does not affect any inference we can make about
    the growth rate.  35% growth is still 35% growth, whether we
    measure 100% of the cases or 50%.
    <P>If, for example, Italy is detecting 50% of the cases and the
    US is detecting 25% of cases, this affects any predictions of how
    far the US is behind Italy At 35% growth, cases double every 2.5
    days, so this undersampling would show the US 2.5 days further
    behind than it really is.
    <P>Likely no-one except Korea and Singapore are getting close to
    100% of cases.  Probably everyone is detecting at least 20% of
    cases, because those require medical attention.  We don't really
    know what fraction of cases are missed, but the difference in
    sampling between countries might skew the delays by a few days in
      either direction.

  <P><B>Q: Comparing with Italy as a whole is flawed. Shouldn't you be comparing with Lombardy?</B>
    <P>Perhaps.  Certainly cases in Italy are concentrated in the
    North at the moment.  Lombardy is running about seven days ahead
    of the rest of the country, as measured by cases per million
    inhabitants. I've shown this in <a href="#g3">graph 3</a>. The
    problem is that cases in some other countries, notably France,
    Spain and the USA, are also concentrated, so comparing these
    entire countries with Lombardy is biased in the other direction.
    These graphs give a crude indication, but they're never going to
    be able to track problems down to the local level, where an
    individual town is overwhelmed by cases before this becomes
    commonplace in a country.  Just remember, to compare with
    Lombardy, a rough approximation is to move the Italy curve seven days
    to the right.
    <P><B>Q: Shouldn't you break out China by province?</B>
    <P> At the moment I'm only showing China on the graphs that show
    absolute counts, not counts per million inhabitants.  As the vast
    majority of Chinese cases were in Hubei, there's not a great deal
    of difference on these graphs between showing Hubei and showing
    all of China.  The population of Hubei province is around 57
    million, which is roughly the same as Italy.  Thus the data for
    China is reasonably comparable with the data for Italy.
<P>
   The Chinese data is somewhat suspect in the early days, so it's not
   very good for comparison until the epidemic gets a fair way along.
   Mostly I'm using Italy to provide a model for how other places
   might progress, as it's a better fit.  But as of March 16th, I've
   changed the last (linear) graph to use the Chinese data to show one
   possible direction that Italy might follow.
<P>
   Elsewhere in China, cases that arose were stamped on quickly, and
   pretty much all of China shut down until that was complete.  In
   Europe we failed to learn from that model, so we're all much
   further along than Beijing, Shanghai, or similar provinces ever
   got.
      
  <P><B>Q: Why didn't you show my country?</B>
    <P>A1. Until the number of cases reaches around 100, the data
    tends to be too noisy to draw conclusions
    <P>A2. The graphs are pretty cluttered as it is.  
    <P>A3. I'll add more as I find time.

  <P><B>Q: You aren't an epidemiologist. Why should I listen to you?</B>
    <P>You probably shouldn't.  I'm a computer scientist and I've
    spend decades analysing data, but you should talk to a real
    epidemiologist if you want to understand the underlying causes.
    Computer scientists do know a lot about exponential growth though.
  <P><B>Q: I'm a journalist.  Will you appear on my TV show?</B>
    <P>No. You should have a real epidemiologist on your TV show.
